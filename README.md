# hello-world
the project will focus on saying hello to the whole world

Hello guys!

You know how it is, when there are occasions that you feel lonely, and you want some company, and suddenly you see on your screen the words "hello world!"
Now you feel that you're a part of something big, the whole world!
And someone has said hello to the whole world (which you are a part from, remember??)
So... They have said hello to you too!
you're not alone any more!
So that, and a lot more, is what this project is about.
Connect, bring peace and harmony to this beautiful planet!
